REST API to Manage a List of Books Using Node.js and Express

This project is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that allows you to manage a list of books entirely in memoryâ€”no database needed. It supports all basic CRUD operations: creating, reading, updating, and deleting books through standard HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

The backend is implemented in server.js, where the API endpoints handle requests and manipulate an in-memory array of book objects. This approach makes it easy to test and modify data without additional setup.

A minimal frontend is included in the public folder, with index.html, style.css, and script.js. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API, enabling users to view, add, update, and delete books dynamically.

The project is ideal for beginners who want to learn how to build REST APIs with Express and connect them to a simple frontend. It also demonstrates how to structure a Node.js project with separate backend and frontend code.

To run the project, install Node.js, install Express, and start the server. You can test API endpoints via the frontend or tools like Postman.
